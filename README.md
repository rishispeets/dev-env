Docker Dev Env
======
This is the Docker environment that I use for remote development. When using remote instances, setting up dotfiles is too time-consuming. Using Docker and the cloud makes my development environment extremely portable. 

## Tip

Running this as a privileged container with `--priviliged` gives the image almost all the capabilities of the host machine. That way, you can more easily develop Docker-in-Docker.
